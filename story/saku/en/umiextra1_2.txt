`Very soon, it will be Tanabata.`
`A familiar event, marked by the hanging of pieces of paper, with wishes written on them, on bamboo branches.`
`It is not often that such wishes are granted,`
` but sometimes, spirits and souls of the dead, or even demons and witches, will find the wishes by chance and grant them...`
`Ushiromiya Maria was supposed to write such a wish at school.`
`There was plenty of paper, so students were allowed to use several pieces, if they could think of enough wishes.`
`At first, everyone was excited about writing a lot of them,`
` but, despite their youth, after writing two or three wishes,`
` they have come to realise to their own surprise that they could only write trivial things, such as {qt}I want to be rich{qt} or {qt}I want to become such and such{qt}.`
`However, unlike the other children, Maria thought that writing one wish was enough.`
`{a:c:{qt}I wish that my Mama would come home every day{qt}}`
`Rosa was busy with work, and had to spend the night there often.`
`Just like a child should, Maria understood that it was just part of her mother's job,`
` but that didn't mean she didn't feel lonely.`
`So she wrote down her simple wish about her mother coming home every day.`
`By the way,`
` have you ever thought about who grants the wishes written on these pieces of paper..?`
`There are several theories:`
` the Tanabata legend and the various ancient Japanese gods,`
` but all of those are, in fact, false.`
`What grants the wish is that which is closest to the person who wrote it.`
`It can be the so-called guardian spirits or ancestors of the person.`
` For those without a guardian spirit, it might be their parents or a close friend.`
`And to Maria, that witch was even closer than her mother.`
`So, in Maria's dreams on the night of the Tanabata,`
` Beato accepted the wish that the girl had entrusted to that piece of paper, and read it...`
`{qt}...Maria... Maria.`
` Can you hear me?{qt}`
`{qt}...Eh?`
` ...Oh, it's {f:5:Beatrice}..!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} came to Maria in a dream..!{qt}`
`{qt}Indeed.`
` Today, you hung a Tanabata wish on some bamboo, did you not?`
` That wish has reached me,`
` ...and I have come to grant it.{qt}`
`{qt}Really?!`
` Thanks, {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Uu!{qt}`
`{qt}Now, let us discuss your wish.`
` You have wished for {qt}your mother to come home every day{qt}.`
` But, are you quite sure?{qt}`
`{qt}Yes.`
` Just that alone will make me happy.{qt}`
`{qt}Hrm...{qt}`
`Beato crossed her arms and mumbled to herself.`
`It seemed as if she was considering turning Maria down, and was thinking of how to best explain herself.`
`When Maria saw Beato, whom she considered all-powerful, make such a face,`
` she grew anxious...`
`{qt}...Uu.`
` Is having Mama come back home a difficult wish to grant?{qt}`
`{qt}No.`
` Quite honestly,`
` it's a piece of cake.`
` But Maria,`
` consider it carefully.`
` Is her merely coming home actually enough?{qt}`
`{qt}.........?{qt}`
`{qt}Should your wish be granted,`
` then from tomorrow on, your mother will return home every single day.`
` However, she may not always be in a good mood, understand?{qt}`
`Rosa was the CEO of a small business.`
` So far, things have been going badly, and she was in a precarious financial situation every day.`
`She was desperately trying to expand her business by clinging on to any order she could get,`
` and using that to bring in more requests little by little.`
`If Rosa would always come home in such a state,`
` it wouldn't end well.`
`In order for Rosa's company to achieve financial security overnight,`
` she'd have to make the wish herself and make it clear exactly what the magic should be used to change.`
`So, even if the magic from Maria's wish could reach Rosa, it would not extend to Rosa's company.`
`In short, if Maria's wish was to be granted with the way she phrased it,`
` Rosa would either lose her job, or her entire company would collapse.`
`That likely wasn't something Maria actually wanted.`
` Hence, Beato visited Maria in her dream to inquire about her true desires.`
`{qt}So, Maria,`
` make your true wish heard.`
` Your mother merely coming home is not quite enough for you, is it?{qt}`
`{qt}.....No.`
` Just having Mama come home every day is...`
` not enough.{qt}`
`{qt}Indeed.`
` Your real wish comes after.{qt}`
`The wish of her mother coming home was only the beginning.`
`Her true desires weren't quite so abstract.`
`Normally, if the ones granting the wish were mischievous, they would grant it no matter how abstract it was.`
`But Beato was Maria's close friend, and would never play such a trick on her.`
`Because she knew that Maria's true wish wasn't quite so simple.`
`{qt}Your mother shall return home. And so I ask: what next..?{qt}`
`{qt}Mama will always come home early... and make dinner with Maria.{qt}`
`{qt}What next..?{qt}`
`{qt}We'll have fun talking together, peeling potatoes and setting up dishes.{qt}`
`{qt}Then..?{qt}`
`{qt}Then, we'll watch TV together,`
` laughing at some funny show and enjoying our delicious meal.`
` That will be so much fun.`
` I'm sure that will make me happy.{qt}`
`She didn't just want her mother to come home every day.`
`The happiness painted in Maria's mind continued far beyond that...`
`It was a wonderful time just to imagine.`
`Two people cooking a meal and enjoying it together while having some small talk.`
`Maria had never once asked Rosa to eat out...`
` Just eating at the table with her mother was more than enough.`
`It made her happy whenever it happened, but it was a very rare occurrence.`
` Maria simply wanted to have that every day.`
`The glimpse of that dream world made Beato smile warmly.`
`Maria was impatient to have her wish be granted,`
` but Beato merely giggled and spoke yet again.`
`{qt}Are you sure this is all you want?{qt}`
`{qt}Eh..?{qt}`
`{qt}I'd imagine your dream extends beyond a mere dinner.`
` ...So for me to consider granting your wish, I need to hear more of it.`
` You two will enjoy a nice dinner together. What next?{qt}`
`{qt}..................{qt}`
`It was only natural.`
` ...Fun meals between mother and daughter were but a part of a healthy family lifestyle.`
`I'll make tea for Mama.`
`As we drink our delicious tea together, we'll watch TV.`
`Then I'll heat up the bath, and we'll bathe together.`
`I'll even put in one of those bubble-filled bath bombs that Mama loves.`
` Then we'll splash around having fun in the tub, and make even more bubbles.`
`Then she'll kiss me goodnight, get things ready for tomorrow, and go to sleep.`
`...Then, the sun will rise, I'll wake up early, and wake Mama up if she oversleeps.`
`Good morning, Sakutaro.`
` Yes, I know.`
` I'll bring Mama something to drink.`
`I'll bring her some original blend vegetable juice in a chilled cup.`
`If she drinks it right after waking up, she'll feel refreshed and smile.`
`I'll put bread in the toaster and cover it with rose-flavored jam.`
`Then I'll wait for the morning paper and set it on Mama's chair.`
`Alright, I'll be back soon, Sakutaro.`
`After a morning like this, I'll be happy all day long at school.`
`School is fun too, and everyone in the rabbit band is always happy as well.`
` They make a real ruckus in my pocket.`
`I'm sure Mama will be successful at work.`
`I'm sure that she'll come back home in a good mood.`
`I'm sure that we will always, always be happy, every day.`
`{qt}........................{qt}`
`I could hear a monotonous, buzzing electronic noise.`
`It was coming from my alarm clock.`
`...Ah.`
` ...I must have been dreaming.`
`{qt}I wish that Mama will come home every day{qt}.`
` A small piece of bamboo with that piece of paper hanging from it was beside my pillow.`
`I wonder if that's why I had such a strange dream.`
`...{f:5:Beatrice} came from Rokkenjima... and clearly showed me a world that I couldn't even see when I was writing that wish of mine down.`
` ...A world in which my Mama would simply come home every day has expanded more and more, into infinity.`
`No, that's not all. Until a second ago, I really was in that world.`
`I'm sure that, just for the smallest of moments, {f:5:Beatrice} granted my wish for me using her magic...`
`She has endlessly expanded my unambitious wish.`
`After all, {f:5:Beatrice} is the Endless witch.`
`...And if the world she has shown me was made by magic, ...as a witch apprentice, I should be able to create it myself.`
`That happy dream, which was so faint that the alarm had drawn me away from it... I should be able to make into something real.`
`As a witch apprentice, Maria knew how to make that magic a reality.`
`{a:c:`
`{qt}...Uu.`
`...By believing.{qt}}`
`Yes.`
` Belief is what grants magic its power.`
`And thus, Maria strongly believed that it wasn't a dream, but something that actually came true.`
`...What's the first thing I should do on this happy morning?`
`That's right.`
` First, I'll wake Mama up.`
`I'll bring her a cup of chilled vegetable juice.`
`Maria jumped out of bed and headed for the kitchen.`
`She wanted to let her mother know that this was the start of a happy morning, which would lead to happy days today and tomorrow.`
`{qt}Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Thank you for making my Tanabata wish come true.`
`{a:c:--The End.}`
`{qt}...The heck was that?`
` It seems like Beato never actually granted her wish.{qt}`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} shrugged mockingly.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}, who had been chuckling at how sweet the story had been, looked annoyed at this wet blanket response.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} noticed Bern's lack of understanding.`
`{qt}That's untrue.`
` I've woven a fragment of the world of Maria's desires, and given her a key to unlock it.`
` The only thing Maria has to do now is to unlock the door.{qt}`
`{qt}Even if you made her happy,`
` ...she made her wish come true herself. You did nothing.{qt}`
`{qt}Bern, you're acting like a spoiled child.`
` There's no way for a wish to be granted unless there is a strong desire for it to come true.{qt}`
`{qt}...Humans with a will that strong will eventually grant that wish themselves, regardless of whether a witch grants it or not.`
` There's no point in witches getting involved at all.{qt}`
`{qt}You see, I wouldn't want to grant someone's wish if they weren't certain about it.{qt}`
`{qt}Exactly.`
` Certainty in willpower creates an absolutely certain future.`
` Our infatuation with the strength of that will leads us to just unconsciously lend them our power, right?{qt}`
`{qt}Yes, precisely.`
` It wouldn't be interesting if the wish weren't bold enough to make us unconsciously want to lend our power.{qt}`
`{qt}Bern, you take people's efforts and the strength of their wishes a little too lightly.{qt}`
`Beato and Lambda kept complaining about Bern's utter lack of comprehension.`
`{qt}...Oh?`
` Then, Lambda, how would you grant a wish?`
` Have you also granted someone's wish on this Tanabata..?{qt}`
`{qt}Hoh...`
` What say you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?`
` I believe that one so beloved by humans should be an expert in granting wishes.{qt}`
`{qt}Me?`
` I keep it simple.`
` I just encourage everyone to give it their all, fairly and equally.{qt}`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} is the Witch of Certainty.`
` She praises the willpower to certainly succeed until the very end.`
`Despite possessing both innocence and cruelty, she also has a more tender side with regards to people's passion.`
`{qt}The most common wishes I get are {qt}I want to be super-rich{qt},`
` or {qt}I want a promotion{qt},`
` or {qt}I want to solidify my current position{qt},`
` things like that.{qt}`
`{qt}Just now, you said that you fairly and equally encourage everyone, but do you really grant such impudent wishes for everyone..?{qt}`
`{qt}Of course not.`
` I avoid granting those wishes to everyone in equal measure.`
` But in exchange, I watch over the ones who don't slack off in their efforts until their wish is realized, also in equal measure.{qt}`
`Lambda will never smile upon humans who wish to 'become super-rich', but do nothing to work towards that goal.`
`Also, she will never grant success to those who only try to become super-rich once.`
`What {f:5:Lambdadelta} bestows is not the fulfillment of the wish, ...but the power needed to achieve it.`
`{qt}Anyone could actually grant the wish of {qt}I want to be super-rich{qt}, you know?`
` Obviously, it would take some effort.`
` What I guarantee is that the effort will not go to waste.{qt}`
`{qt}...However, you make no guarantees about the necessary amount of effort, huh?{qt}`
`{qt}*cackle*cackle*.`
` I see.`
` Effort will eventually bring fruit, but you can't promise when.`
` You are quite cruel.{qt}`
`{qt}Really?`
` You don't think the guarantee that your efforts will bring fruit is worth much?`
` ...You see, I like hard-working people.`
` I like people who throw away everything for their goal, and who are capable of abandoning themselves to unending self-torment to achieve it.{qt}`
`Those who make their wishes to {f:5:Lambdadelta} must strongly believe that those wishes will be granted eventually.`
`Without the strength of heart, the wishes would never reach {f:5:Lambdadelta}, and would never be granted the help of the magic of Certainty.`
`And, to those people who certainly never give up, and do not forget the meaning of hard work,`
` it's blasphemous to all their hard work to have their wishes simply be granted by another person.`
`That's why {f:5:Lambdadelta} would never dirty their precious hard work.`
`All she promises is that certain determination will lead to a certain success.`
`And, just that is enough.`
`Your wish will certainly be granted.`
` No matter what it is.`
` Some day.`
`Even if you are just a child who wishes to become a god...`
`{qt}Hmm.`
` So that is the Magic of Certainty.`
` A magnificent power that is in no way inferior to my own Endless Magic.{qt}`
`{qt}Yeah right, it's way better...!`
` You're rock.`
` I'm paper!`
` Double-twisted, super-thick super-paper!{qt}`
`{qt}...That just means you're a wound-up idiot.`
` Well, I suppose that fits.{qt}`
`{qt}Right!?`
` Ohohohoho!{qt}`
`With Lambda being the only one who didn't get it, the three witches cackled together...`
`{qt}Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, are you not the witch who controls miracles?`
` There must me as many humans who want you to grant a wish as there are stars in the sky.{qt}`
`{qt}Yeah, miracles.`
` Those are not something that should ever be granted.`
` Though I imagine the overly ambitious yet lazy people would love that.`
` But that's no good at all!`
` Those filthy wishes are unfitting for someone as wonderful as you, Bern.`
` Before you look at wishes of people like that, grant my wish first, Be~rn!{qt}`
`{qt}...Let go of me, you're too warm.`
` Miracles are called miracles because they don't happen.`
` To me, granting a wish is in itself a miracle.{qt}`
`{qt}Human passions don't generally amount to much to us witches...`
` But it seems they don't amount to anything at all to you.{qt}`
`{qt}...I don't want to hear that from someone who made a name for herself through endless cruelty.{qt}`
`{qt}*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahhahahahahahahaha!`
` Not much I can say against that.`
` I may have been too uncharacteristically soft today.{qt}`
`{qt}Well, you are really easy-going when it comes to Maria, Beato.`
` You should spread that around to more people besides Maria.`
` You're like sugar leftovers.{qt}`
`{qt}...Exactly.`
` It's not just Beato, either.`
` You too have been easy-going today, Lambda.`
` Both of you are a little too sweet for my liking today.`
` ...Dried plums go better with tea than sugar.{qt}`
`{qt}Bern,`
` it's not like Tanabata comes every day, right?`
` Go and grant at least one wish.{qt}`
`{qt}Nope.{qt}`
`With a fed up look on her face, Bern disappeared.`
`She had lost her humanity over a thousand years.`
` She no longer enjoyed sweet and heartwarming stories.`
`Beato laughed coldly, as though this was the way a witch was supposed to be.`
`In her expression, no longer was there any of the warmth that had woven Maria's happiness...`
`You're telling me to grant at least one wish because it's Tanabata?`
`Hrmphff.`
`I am a witch.`
` The Witch of Miracles.`
`...No matter the effort, luck, or enthusiasm,`
` ...I know the miracle never happens.`
`Precisely because I know that, I am the Witch of Miracles.`
`So what kind of a wish must I grant..?`
`So what if it's Tanabata?`
` They're just being a little too festive.`
`Expanding a happy dream into infinity?`
`Efforts which would certainly bring fruit..?`
`All of this is so sickening that I'm about to vomit.`
` Blergh, how disgusting.`
`Oh... you think so too?`
`Well then.`
`Allow me to demonstrate how witches must truly grant wishes.`
`Because you're obviously looking forward to that.`
`Little Ange took a small piece of paper at school and wrote {qt}I wish for my family to come home{qt} on it,`
` hung it on a bamboo branch, and fastened that to her bed post.`
`Then, she clapped, and made her wish again so that it would come true...`
`Thanks to her strong wish, Bern has appeared to her in the land of illusions, the world of sleep.`
`{qt}...Hello, Ange.`
` So, this is your wish?{qt}`
`{qt}Y-yeah...`
` Who...who are you?{qt}`
`{qt}I will not tell you my name.`
` This is the world of slumber, a world like the receding tide.`
` ...Should I tell you my name, you'll forget it anyway.{qt}`
`{qt}..................{qt}`
`{qt}Well then, your wish.`
` ...I wouldn't mind causing a miracle and granting your wish.{qt}`
`{qt}..Really?`
` Really..?!{qt}`
`{qt}Yes.`
` Really.`
` ...However, magic is something that will not be granted unless you wish for it strongly and work hard for it.`
` Lambda explained the basics to me.`
` Honestly, such a pain.{qt}`
`Ange couldn't hide her surprise seeing this witch intrude her dream and claim that she would grant her wish.`
`However, she felt that the witch wanted something in exchange for the miracle.`
`...But Ange decided that she would do anything if her family would come back home.`
`{qt}I'll work as hard as you want me to, miss witch.`
` Please, grant my wish..!{qt}`
`{qt}...Very well.`
` If you follow my instructions every single day,`
` if your desire for that wish to be truly granted reaches the heavens,`
` ...I will certainly visit you again and grant it.{qt}`
`But I won't say when that shall be. It could be a year, five, or even ten or more.`
`In that regard, I guess I'm about the same as Lambda.`
` I will grant it in the end, so nothing else matters, right?`
` *giggle*...`
`{qt}Then, miss witch,`
` what should I do..?{qt}`
`{qt}Today,`
` your adoptive mother, Ushiromiya Eva, has told you to consider her a replacement for your mother, and that you could count on her for anything at all, didn't she..?{qt}`
`{qt}Y-yeah...{qt}`
`Eva... did say that to Ange today.`
`As aunt and niece, we are connected.`
` As aunt and niece, we are connected.`
` But we are also connected in that I have lost my child, and you have lost your parents.`
`And we cannot trick ourselves into thinking of each other as replacements for our lost family.`
`Even so, I consider you my own daughter.`
`So please allow me to ask you to...`
` consider myself your mother and count on me for anything you might need.`
`After saying that, Eva hugged Ange.`
`To little Ange, Mom was Mom, and Eva definitely wasn't.`
` ...However, she understood the the meaning of those words, and the affection verging on sorrow.`
`But as would be expected from a child her age, she needed some time to accept this...`
`{qt}Yeah.`
` Auntie Eva did say that.{qt}`
`{qt}If you truly,`
` from the bottom of your heart, wish for your real mother to return...`
` then you must never let anyone else take her place.`
` If her place in your heart is taken by someone else, she will never come back home.{qt}`
`{qt}...{qt}`
`To little Ange, that seemed very logical.`
`If she accepted someone who wasn't her mother as her mother,`
` her real mother would have no home to return to...`
`{qt}...Alright?`
` That's important for your real mother, is it not..?{qt}`
`{qt}Y-yeah...,`
` miss witch.`
` Auntie Eva is just Auntie Eva.`
` I will never call her my mother.{qt}`
`{qt}Wonderful.`
` But Aunt Eva also told you something else, did she not?{qt}`
`Right now, we cannot forget the scars on our hearts, and together we have forgotten how to smile.`
`However, I believe that this would surely sadden my child and your parents.`
`...Wouldn't it be alright if we could remember how to smile, if only a little bit at a time?`
`Of course, we can't do this right away.`
`We have to remember our forgotten smiles bit by bit.`
`That's why.....I've decided that from today on, I'll try my best to practice smiling.`
`That's weird...`
` isn't it?`
`Ange-chan, if you ever remember how to smile,`
` ...please show me too.`
`I feel that if we do that, we'll be able to remember how to smile even better.`
`{qt}Yes.`
` ...Auntie Eva definitely said that.{qt}`
`{qt}If you want your family to come back, your pain and sorrow must be strong enough to lift that wish to the heavens.`
` Until that day, you must not smile even once.{qt}`
`{qt}Not... even... once.`
`{qt}Exactly.`
` ...I'll be watching over you.`
` If it seems like a smile is going to come upon your face, even once,`
` ...I'll consider that a sign that you no longer care about your family coming back.`
` I promise you that in that case, they will never return.{qt}`
`{qt}...I don't want that!`
` I will never smile again!`
` Not until Dad, Mom and Onii-chan come home..!{qt}`
`{qt}You must never feel happiness.`
` You must never experience joy.`
` You must never forget the sorrow of losing your family.`
` ...And you must stay away from the demon who will try to make you forget that, who will try and deceive you.{qt}`
`{qt}...Ushiromiya Eva will try and crush that resolve many times with her sweet words.`
` But you must never listen to them, alright..?`
` Eva is a demon who will try and steal away your family for all eternity.`
` *giggle*`
` No, she actually {bold:did steal them away}.{qt}`
`{qt}M-my resolve won't break..!`
` Until my wish comes true, I will certainly not listen to Auntie Eva's words..!`
` Please, grant my wish, miss witch..!{qt}`
`{qt}Fine.`
` As long as you continue to keep your promise,`
` firmly and forever,`
` ...then in the end, I will definitely appear before you and grant your wish.`
` ...It's alright.`
` I will definitely not ignore your pure-hearted resolve.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*.{qt}`
`The next morning.`
`Ushiromiya Ange clearly announced it to Eva.`
`Those words were... a spell that would bring forth the miracle of her family coming home.`
`And they were also a curse that the cruel witch had made her say.`
`On that day... those words have forever... stolen the smiles from both Eva and Ange...`
`{qt}...Isn't this kind of Tanabata`
` much more pleasant for a witch?`
` *giggle*`
` Ahhahahahahahaha.`
` Ahh, this won't get boring.`
` Not for a while.{qt}`
`These kinds of fragments exist, but... what do you think?`
`All of you who like these kinds of ill-natured stories... would much prefer something this bitter, right?`
`Will this do,`
` Beato?`
`All I really did was make it a tale more suited to my role.`
